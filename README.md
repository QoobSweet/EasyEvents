#  Easy Events v3  #
## Setup
  Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```
## Build
  To build the JavaScript version of your component:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:

  ```bash
  npm run build:watch
  ```

  Both the TypeScript compiler and lit-analyzer are configured to be very strict. You may want to change `tsconfig.json` to make them less strict.
